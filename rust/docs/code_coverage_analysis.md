- **Single Node Trees**: Root-only scenarios
- **Boundary Conditions**: Capacity limits and minimum values

### ⚠️ Areas with Lower Coverage (~15% uncovered)

#### Complex Rebalancing Scenarios

- **Multi-level Merging**: Cascading merge operations
- **Deep Tree Rebalancing**: Complex rebalancing in tall trees

#### Error Handling Paths

- **Invalid Operations**: Edge cases in error conditions
- **Defensive Code**: Rarely-triggered safety checks
- **Arena Boundary Conditions**: Out-of-bounds access protection

#### Advanced Deletion Scenarios

- **Complex Branch Merging**: Multi-step branch consolidation
- **Root Collapse Chains**: Multiple consecutive root collapses
- **Underflow Propagation**: Cascading underflow handling

## Test Quality Assessment

### Strengths

1. **Comprehensive Functional Coverage**

   - All major B+ tree operations are thoroughly tested
   - Insert, lookup, delete, and iteration operations have excellent coverage
   - Both single-operation and bulk-operation scenarios are covered

2. **Robust Edge Case Testing**

   - Empty tree operations
   - Single-element trees
   - Capacity boundary conditions
   - Invalid input handling

3. **Stress Testing**

   - Fuzz tests with random insertion patterns
   - Large dataset operations (up to 10,000 items)
   - Performance validation with timing constraints

4. **Data Structure Integrity Validation**

   - Invariant checking after every operation
   - Cross-validation against Rust's BTreeMap
   - Linked list consistency verification

5. **Multiple Test Perspectives**
   - Unit tests for individual operations
   - Integration tests for complex scenarios
   - Stress tests for performance and robustness

### Areas for Improvement

1. **Branch Node Borrowing Operations**

   ```rust
   // Functions needing more coverage:
   // - borrow_from_left_branch()
   // - borrow_from_right_branch()
   // - Complex borrowing scenarios
   ```

2. **Complex Merge Scenarios**

   ```rust
   // Scenarios needing coverage:
   // - Multiple consecutive merges
   // - Branch merging with cascading effects
   // - Merge operations near tree boundaries
   ```

3. **Error Path Completeness**

   ```rust
   // Error conditions needing coverage:
   // - Arena overflow scenarios
   // - Invalid ID references
   // - Corrupted tree structure handling
   ```

4. **Deep Tree Operations**
   ```rust
   // Scenarios for deep trees (4+ levels):
   // - Multi-level rebalancing
   // - Deep insertion with multiple splits
   // - Root promotion in very tall trees
   ```

## Coverage by Code Section

   ```rust
   #[test]
   fn test_branch_borrow_from_left_sibling() {
       // Test branch node borrowing scenarios
   }

   #[test]
   fn test_leaf_borrow_complex_scenarios() {
       // Test edge cases in leaf borrowing
   }
   ```

2. **Enhance Merge Testing**

   ```rust
   #[test]
   fn test_cascading_merges() {
       // Test multiple consecutive merge operations
   }
   ```

3. **Deep Tree Scenarios**
   ```rust
   #[test]
   fn test_very_deep_tree_operations() {
       // Create trees with 5+ levels and test operations
   }
   ```

### Long-term Improvements

1. **Property-Based Testing**

   - Implement QuickCheck-style property tests
   - Verify invariants hold for all possible operation sequences

2. **Mutation Testing**

   - Use tools like `cargo-mutants` to verify test quality
   - Ensure tests catch subtle implementation bugs

3. **Performance Regression Testing**
   - Add automated performance benchmarks
   - Track coverage of performance-critical paths
