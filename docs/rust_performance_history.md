# Rust B+ Tree Performance History

This document tracks the performance evolution of the Rust B+ tree implementation compared to Rust's standard `BTreeMap`.

## üéØ Performance Targets

**Goal**: Achieve competitive performance with `std::collections::BTreeMap`
- **Target**: Within 2x performance for all operations
- **Stretch goal**: Match or exceed BTreeMap performance in some operations

## üìà Performance Evolution by Commit

### Arena Migration + Optimizations
**Commit**: `53be91e` - "refactor: eliminate next_id fields with helper methods"
**Architecture**: Full arena-based allocation, unified `InsertResult`, simplified ID management
**Test Environment**: MacBook (ARM64), Rust 1.x, `--release` mode

**Performance Results (10,000 items, capacity=16)**:
```
=== INSERTION BENCHMARK ===
BTreeMap insertion: 353¬µs
BPlusTreeMap insertion: 469¬µs  
Ratio (BPlus/BTree): 1.33x (33% slower)

=== LOOKUP BENCHMARK ===
BTreeMap lookups: 253¬µs
BPlusTreeMap lookups: 182¬µs
Ratio (BPlus/BTree): 0.72x (28% FASTER) ‚úÖ

=== ITERATION BENCHMARK ===
BTreeMap iteration: 211¬µs
BPlusTreeMap iteration: 103¬µs
Ratio (BPlus/BTree): 0.49x (51% FASTER) ‚úÖ
```

**Capacity Optimization Results**:
| Capacity | Insert Ratio | Lookup Ratio | Iter Ratio | Performance |
|----------|--------------|--------------|------------|-------------|
| 4        | 3.96x slower | 1.51x slower | 1.24x slower | Poor |
| 8        | 2.27x slower | **0.99x** (equal) | **0.60x** (40% faster) | Good |
| **16**   | 1.33x slower | **0.72x** (28% faster) | **0.49x** (51% faster) | **Optimal** |
| 32       | **0.88x** (12% faster) | **0.69x** (31% faster) | **0.41x** (59% faster) | Excellent |
| 64       | **0.81x** (19% faster) | **0.53x** (47% faster) | **0.27x** (73% faster) | Excellent |
| 128      | **0.60x** (40% faster) | **0.50x** (50% faster) | **0.30x** (70% faster) | Best |

## üìä Performance Summary

| Operation | BTreeMap Time | BPlusTreeMap Time | Ratio | Status |
|-----------|---------------|-------------------|-------|---------|
| **Insertion** | 747¬µs | 939¬µs | 1.26x slower | ‚ö†Ô∏è Target |
| **Lookup** | 2.72ms | 2.03ms | **0.75x (25% faster)** | ‚úÖ **Exceeded** |
| **Iteration** | 973¬µs | 1.00ms | 1.03x slower | ‚úÖ Target |

### üèÜ Key Achievements

1. **Lookup Performance**: **25% FASTER** than BTreeMap! 
   - This is unexpected and impressive for a B+ tree vs B-tree
   - Likely due to arena allocation providing better cache locality

2. **Iteration Performance**: Within 3% of BTreeMap (essentially equal)
   - Very good for a different data structure

3. **Insertion Performance**: 26% slower but within reasonable bounds
   - Still meeting the <2x target comfortably

## üî¨ Technical Analysis

### Why Lookups Excel
The 25% lookup advantage is remarkable and likely due to:

1. **Arena Allocation**: Better memory locality
   - All nodes stored in contiguous Vec storage
   - Reduced pointer chasing vs BTreeMap's heap allocation
   - Better cache utilization

2. **Node Design**: Optimized for search
   - Simple Vec<K> binary search within nodes
   - Predictable memory layout

3. **Capacity=16**: Sweet spot for cache efficiency
   - Node size fits well in cache lines
   - 4-5 comparisons per node (reasonable)

### Why Insertions Are Slower
The 26% insertion overhead likely comes from:

1. **Arena Management**: Additional allocation logic
   - Free list management
   - Arena resizing when needed

2. **Splitting Logic**: More complex than BTreeMap
   - Need to allocate new nodes in arena
   - More bookkeeping for arena IDs

3. **B+ Tree Structure**: Different insertion patterns
   - All data in leaves (higher insertion cost)
   - More node splits compared to B-tree

### Iteration Performance
Nearly identical performance (3% difference) suggests:
- Both implementations have efficient iteration
- Arena allocation doesn't hurt sequential access
- B+ tree's leaf-linked design works well

## üöÄ Optimization Opportunities

### For Insertion Performance
1. **Pre-allocation**: Reserve arena space for common insertion patterns
2. **Batch Insertion**: Optimize for multiple insertions
3. **Node Merging**: Improve splitting/merging efficiency

### For Further Lookup Gains
1. **Prefetching**: CPU hints for next node access
2. **SIMD**: Vectorized comparisons within nodes  
3. **Capacity Tuning**: Test other node capacities

### Memory Efficiency
1. **Compact Node Layout**: Reduce per-node overhead
2. **Arena Compaction**: Reduce fragmentation over time

## üéâ Success Metrics

### ‚úÖ Targets Exceeded
- **Lookup Performance**: 25% faster (target: competitive)
- **Overall Competitiveness**: All operations within 2x target

### ‚úÖ Architecture Goals Achieved  
- **Full Arena Allocation**: No Box-based heap allocation
- **Simplified Design**: Unified InsertResult, clean ID management
- **Memory Safety**: All 70 tests passing
- **Performance Stability**: Consistent behavior

## üìà Performance Comparison Context

**vs Python B+ Tree (from Python performance history)**:
- Python lookups: ~148 ns/op (C extension, optimized)
- Rust lookups: ~20 ns/op (estimated from 2.03ms/100k)
- **Rust is ~7x faster** than optimized C extension

**vs Standard Library**:
- Competitive with highly optimized `std::collections::BTreeMap`
- **Exceeds BTreeMap in lookup performance** (primary operation)
- Within reasonable bounds for insert/iteration

| **Arena migration complete** | `203cb68` | Unified architecture, simplified splits |
| **Arena renaming cleanup** | `8ad9b30` | Code clarity, no performance impact |
| **Arena ID simplification** | `6774b9f` | Cleaner allocation, minimal impact |

## üí° Capacity Optimization Recommendations

Based on comprehensive testing across capacities 4-128:

### **Optimal Capacity Choice by Workload**

| Workload Type | Recommended Capacity | Rationale |
|---------------|---------------------|-----------|
| **Insert-Heavy** | **64-128** | 19-40% faster insertions |
| **Lookup-Heavy** | **64-128** | 47-50% faster lookups |
| **Iteration-Heavy** | **32-128** | 59-73% faster iteration |
| **Balanced** | **32** | Good performance across all operations |
| **Memory-Constrained** | **16** | Original design, well-tested, reasonable performance |

### **Key Findings from Capacity Testing**

1. **Higher capacities dramatically improve performance**:
   - Capacity 128: 40% faster insertions, 50% faster lookups, 70% faster iteration
   - Capacity 64: 19% faster insertions, 47% faster lookups, 73% faster iteration
   - Capacity 32: 12% faster insertions, 31% faster lookups, 59% faster iteration

2. **Sweet spots identified**:
   - **Capacity 32+**: All operations faster than BTreeMap
   - **Capacity 64**: Optimal balance of performance vs memory
   - **Capacity 128**: Maximum performance, higher memory usage

3. **Trade-offs**:
   - Higher capacity = better performance but more memory per node
   - Lower capacity = worse performance but better memory efficiency
   - Capacity 4-8: Poor performance, not recommended for production

## üîç Next Steps

1. **‚úÖ Capacity Optimization**: Complete - Tested capacities 4-128
2. **Range Query Benchmarks**: Test B+ tree's natural advantage vs BTreeMap ranges
3. **Memory Usage Analysis**: Compare memory overhead vs BTreeMap across capacities
4. **Real-World Workloads**: Test with application-specific patterns
5. **Dynamic Capacity**: Consider allowing runtime capacity configuration

## üöÄ Production Recommendations

### **Default Configuration**
```rust
// Recommended for most applications
BPlusTreeMap::new(64)  // Excellent performance balance
```

### **Performance-Critical Applications**
```rust
// Maximum performance (if memory allows)
BPlusTreeMap::new(128)  // Best overall performance
```

### **Memory-Constrained Environments**
```rust
// Balanced approach
BPlusTreeMap::new(32)  // Still beats BTreeMap in all operations
```
