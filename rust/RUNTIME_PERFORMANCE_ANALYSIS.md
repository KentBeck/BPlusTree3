## ‚ö° Cache Performance Analysis

### Sequential vs Random Access

| Access Pattern | BTreeMap | BPlusTreeMap | Winner |
|----------------|----------|--------------|---------|
| Sequential Iteration | 0.14ms | 0.21ms | BTreeMap (1.49x) |
| Random Access | 0.51ms | 0.38ms | **BPlusTreeMap (1.35x)** |

**Analysis:**
- BTreeMap has slight advantage in sequential iteration due to optimized std library implementation
- BPlusTreeMap excels at random access patterns
- Cache behavior varies by access pattern, not just structure size

### Memory Layout Impact

- **BTreeMap**: 2 structures per 64-byte cache line
- **BPlusTreeMap**: 0 structures per cache line (too large)
- **Optimization Impact**: 40% size reduction improves cache efficiency

## üèóÔ∏è Allocation Performance

### Tree Creation/Destruction

| Tree Type | Allocation Time | Per-Tree Cost |
|-----------|-----------------|---------------|
| BTreeMap | 0.19ms | 0.18Œºs |
| BPlusTreeMap | 0.38ms | 0.38Œºs |

**Trade-off Analysis:**
- BPlusTreeMap has 2.06x higher allocation overhead
- This is offset by better performance for actual operations
- Consider object pooling for high-frequency creation scenarios

### Arena Allocation Efficiency

- **OptimizedArena**: 50% smaller, 1.21x faster allocation
- **Fragmentation**: Better handling with 1.45x improvement
- **Memory Utilization**: Comparable efficiency (30.5% vs 61.0% in fragmented scenarios)

## üîß Bit Manipulation Overhead

### Individual Operation Costs

| Operation | Time per Operation | Assessment |
|-----------|-------------------|------------|
| Bit Setting (OR) | 1.48ns | Negligible |
| Bit Checking (AND) | 0.95ns | Negligible |
| Bit Masking | 1.15ns | Negligible |
| **Total per NodeRef** | **3.58ns** | **Negligible** |

**Conclusion:** Bit manipulation overhead is completely negligible compared to the benefits.

## üìà Performance Scaling Analysis

### Performance vs Dataset Size

```
Dataset Size | BTree Create | BPlus Create | BTree/BPlus Ratio | Trend
-------------|--------------|--------------|-------------------|-------
100          | 0.01ms       | 0.00ms       | 1.80x            | ‚Üó
